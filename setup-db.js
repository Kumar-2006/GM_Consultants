Residential areas typically have FSI between 1.0-2.5, while commercial areas may have higher FSI. Always check with local authorities for specific FSI applicable to your plot. Consider factors like road width, plot size, and surrounding development when calculating permissible construction area.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Zoning Norms and Regulations',
    content: 'Zoning regulations define how land can be used in different areas. Common zones include Residential (R1, R2, R3), Commercial (C1, C2), Industrial (I1, I2), and Mixed Use. Each zone has specific restrictions on building height, setbacks, parking requirements, and permitted uses. Violation of zoning norms can result in rejection of plans or legal issues.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Setback Requirements',
    content: 'Setbacks are minimum distances that buildings must maintain from property boundaries. Front setback is typically 6-9 meters, side setbacks 3-6 meters, and rear setback 3-6 meters depending on plot size and zone. These requirements ensure proper ventilation, light, and emergency access. Setback violations are strictly penalized and can lead to demolition orders.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Parking Requirements',
    content: 'Minimum parking spaces are mandated based on building type and size. Residential buildings require 1-2 parking spaces per unit, commercial buildings need 1 space per 50-100 sq.m of built area, and offices require 1 space per 25-50 sq.m. Parking must be provided within the plot boundaries and should not obstruct fire access routes.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Fire Safety Regulations',
    content: 'All buildings must comply with fire safety norms including fire exits, staircases, fire fighting equipment, and emergency lighting. Buildings above 15m height require additional fire safety measures like fire pumps, sprinkler systems, and fire alarm systems. Fire department clearance is mandatory before occupancy certificate issuance.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Environmental Clearances',
    content: 'Projects above certain thresholds require environmental clearances from State/National authorities. Residential projects above 20,000 sq.m or commercial projects above 1,00,000 sq.m need Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). Smaller projects may need Consent to Establish and Operate from Pollution Control Board.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Structural Design Requirements',
    content: 'All buildings must be designed by licensed structural engineers following relevant codes (IS 456, IS 1893, IS 875). Structural drawings must be certified and submitted for approval. Special requirements apply for seismic zones, high-rise buildings, and buildings with unusual loads or configurations.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Accessibility Standards',
    content: 'Buildings must comply with accessibility standards for persons with disabilities. This includes ramps, elevators, accessible toilets, and tactile indicators. Commercial and public buildings have stricter accessibility requirements. Non-compliance can result in rejection of plans or denial of occupancy certificates.'
